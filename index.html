  Studies have shown that 
birds, especially sage grouse, other native grouse and game birds are 
killed or injured when they hit fences while flying to and from feeding, 
watering and lekking areas at dusk and dawn. These studies have also 
shown that fence collisions can be greatly reduced by attaching fence 
markers to problem fences in areas used by these birds.<br>

  Flysafe markers have been constructed specifically for this purpose.
</p>
<p>Flysafe Markers Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Made of polypropylene plastic</li>
  <li>Developed to be UV resistant</li>
  <li>Stay pliable in extreme heat and cold</li>
  <li>Resist fading</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other markers have failed in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>
  Recommended and stocked in bright yellow with a one inch foil strip 
to increase visibility. Other colors available by request and 10 to 
12 hour glow in the dark by custom order. Quickly and easily attached 
by repeating hog ring applicator. Flysafe markers have been designed 
to be more visible and durable, thus more cost effective.
<br><br>
  Volume pricing available upon request.

                Studies have shown that
                birds, especially sage grouse, other native grouse and game birds are
                killed or injured when they hit fences while flying to and from feeding,
                watering and lekking areas at dusk and dawn. These studies have also
                shown that fence collisions can be greatly reduced by attaching fence
                markers to problem fences in areas used by these birds.<br>

                Flysafe markers have been constructed specifically for this purpose.

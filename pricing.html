                This is without the reflective strip, which is highly recommended for greater visibility. The tape is temperature rated from -40 degrees to 302 degrees F. If you want to apply the tape yourself we can supply it for $5.50 per 50 yard roll. One roll will do 300 markers.
            </p><p>
                If you would like us to put the tape on the markers, the price is as follows:
